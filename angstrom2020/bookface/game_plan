printf to leak stack address, pie & libc
    rate fmt string for each
    get leak
    change ratings to 10 so we don't trigger the 0 write


time to screw with random_r internals so it always returns 0
set user->friends to unsafe_state->fptr
    write 0
set user->friends to unsafe_state->rptr
    write 0


set user->friends to saved rbp address
    add friends equivalent to rbp address
deref user->friends and write 0 to rbp (stack pivot time!!!!)
    logout again and this time make sure the survey is mean
    write will happen
on leave, stack pivot to 0, where we can use friends to write the
ret to one_gadget
profit????
